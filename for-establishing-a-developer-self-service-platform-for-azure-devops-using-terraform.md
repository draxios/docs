# Establishing a Developer Self-Service Platform for Azure DevOps using Terraform

## Introduction

This white paper outlines a comprehensive strategy to establish a Self-Service Platform for Azure DevOps (ADO) using Terraform. The goal is to enable developers to manage and deploy their resources in ADO efficiently and securely, leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform. This platform will use Terraform modules and the Azure DevOps Terraform provider, managed by Terraform Enterprise (TFE), ensuring a robust, scalable, and secure solution. 

---

## 1. Infrastructure Overview

### Objective
The infrastructure aims to provide a clear, scalable, and maintainable structure that mirrors the hierarchy within ADO and supports efficient resource management through Terraform.

### Structure
- **Root Folder**: Represents the Azure DevOps organization.
- **Organization Folder**: Contains project-level properties and configurations.
- **Project Folder**: Includes repositories, pipelines, policies, and other resources.

### Example Structure:
```
Atari/
  ├── AgentPool.tf
  ├── Pong/
      ├── LibraryGroups/
          └── VariableGroup.tf
      ├── Repos/
          ├── Repo.tf
          ├── ReposPolicy.tf
          ├── Pipeline.tf
          └── PipelinesPolicy.tf
      ├── User.tf
      ├── Group.tf
      └── Pong.tf
```

This structure ensures that resources are organized logically, making it easier to manage and scale the platform.

## 2. Terraform Modules

### Consistency and Reusability
- **Modular Approach**: Create Terraform modules to encapsulate resource management logic.
- **Version Control**: Ensure modules are versioned and documented for consistency and reusability.
- **Standardization**: Implement standardized naming conventions and practices across all modules.

### Example Module: `azuredevops_project`
```hcl
module "azuredevops_project" {
  source = "path/to/module"
  
  project_name        = var.project_name
  organization_name   = var.organization_name
  visibility          = var.visibility
  description         = var.description
}
```

### Benefits
- **Reusability**: Modules promote reusability across different projects.
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent implementation of resources, reducing errors and redundancy.

### Additional Example Modules
#### `azuredevops_repo`
```hcl
module "azuredevops_repo" {
  source = "path/to/module"

  repo_name         = var.repo_name
  project_name      = var.project_name
  initialization_script = var.initialization_script
}
```

#### `azuredevops_pipeline`
```hcl
module "azuredevops_pipeline" {
  source = "path/to/module"

  pipeline_name     = var.pipeline_name
  project_name      = var.project_name
  yaml_path         = var.yaml_path
  trigger_branch    = var.trigger_branch
}
```

## 3. Terraform Enterprise (TFE) Management

### State and Workflow Management
- **State Management**: Utilize TFE for centralized state management to avoid state file conflicts and ensure data consistency.
- **Workflow Automation**: Leverage TFE's workflow automation to streamline the deployment process.

### Workflow
1. Code changes are pushed to the Azure DevOps repo.
2. TFE detects changes and triggers the corresponding workspace.
3. Terraform applies the changes to the ADO environment.

### Example Workflow Script
```hcl
# TFE Workspace Configuration
resource "tfe_workspace" "example" {
  name         = "example-workspace"
  organization = "my-org"
  execution_mode = "remote"
  terraform_version = "1.1.7"

  vcs_repo {
    identifier     = "my-org/my-repo"
    branch         = "main"
    oauth_token_id = "ot-ABC123"
  }
}

# Terraform State Backend Configuration
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "my-org"

    workspaces {
      name = "example-workspace"
    }
  }
}
```

### Automation Steps
1. A front-end interface triggers an AWS Lambda function.
2. The Lambda function injects necessary files into the repo.
3. The Lambda function triggers the appropriate TFE workspace.

### Example AWS Lambda Function
```python
import boto3
import os

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    repo_name = event['repo_name']
    file_content = event['file_content']
    
    # Assume role to get access to the repository
    assumed_role = boto3.client('sts').assume_role(
        RoleArn=os.environ['ROLE_ARN'],
        RoleSessionName='AssumeRoleSession'
    )
    
    credentials = assumed_role['Credentials']
    
    client = boto3.client('codecommit',
                          aws_access_key_id=credentials['AccessKeyId'],
                          aws_secret_access_key=credentials['SecretAccessKey'],
                          aws_session_token=credentials['SessionToken'])
    
    response = client.put_file(
        repositoryName=repo_name,
        branchName='main',
        fileContent=file_content,
        filePath='path/to/file',
        commitMessage='Initial commit',
        name='LambdaBot',
        email='lambdabot@example.com'
    )
    
    return response
```

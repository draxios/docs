# For Establishing a Developer Self-Service Platform for Azure DevOps using Terraform

## Introduction
This white paper outlines a comprehensive strategy to establish a Developer Self-Service Platform for Azure DevOps (ADO) using Terraform. The goal is to enable developers to manage and deploy their resources in ADO efficiently and securely, leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles with Terraform. This platform will use Terraform modules and the Azure DevOps Terraform provider, managed by Terraform Enterprise (TFE), ensuring a robust, scalable, and secure solution.

---

## 1. Infrastructure Overview
The platform will utilize Terraform for IaC, with code hosted in Azure DevOps repositories. The structure of the repositories will mirror the hierarchy in ADO:

- **Root Folder**: Represents the Azure DevOps organization.
- **Organization Folder**: Contains project-level properties and configurations.
- **Project Folder**: Includes repositories, pipelines, policies, and other resources.

### Example structure:
```
StokerINC/
  ├── Pong/
      ├── Deploy/
          └── DeployPolicy.tf
      ├── Repo.tf
      ├── ProjectProperties.tf
```

## 2. Terraform Modules
To ensure consistency and reusability, we will create Terraform modules that wrap around the Azure DevOps Terraform provider. These modules will encapsulate the logic for managing resources like projects, repositories, pipelines, and policies.

### Example Module: `azuredevops_project`
```hcl
module "azuredevops_project" {
  source = "path/to/module"
  
  project_name        = var.project_name
  organization_name   = var.organization_name
  visibility          = var.visibility
  description         = var.description
}
```

## 3. Terraform Enterprise (TFE) Management
We will utilize TFE to manage the Terraform state and workflows. There will be an organizational baseline workspace and individual workspaces for each project folder.

### Workflow:
1. Code changes are pushed to the Azure DevOps repo.
2. TFE detects changes and triggers the corresponding workspace.
3. Terraform applies the changes to the ADO environment.

## 4. Self-Service Automation
The self-service platform will inject files into the Git repo and trigger the affected workspaces. This process will be automated through a combination of AWS Lambda and TFE.

### Automation Steps:
1. A front-end interface triggers an AWS Lambda function.
2. The Lambda function injects necessary files into the repo.
3. The Lambda function triggers the appropriate TFE workspace.

## 5. Permissions and Security
Permissions will be managed using a master service account that owns projects and handles automation. The hierarchy of permissions will be as follows:

- **Master Account**: Highest privileges, managed by a service account.
- **Build Admins**: Next level of administrators with specific permissions.
- **Project-Level Permissions**: Defined explicitly for each role, following best practices for security.

## 6. Naming Conventions
Naming conventions will follow best practices, primarily using kebab-case for consistency and readability.

## 7. Package Feeds
There will be an organization-level feed for consumable packages, controlled by a specific service account. Project-level feeds will be managed based on defined permissions in Terraform.

## 8. Manual Overrides via CyberArk
A specific team will have the ability to check out the master account via CyberArk to make manual changes when necessary.

## 9. Pipeline and Code Quality Tools
All build and deployment pipelines will use YAML, with gated environments for quality assurance. The following tools will be integrated for code quality and security:

- **Linters**: Ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
- **Python Testers**: Automated testing for Python code.
- **Security Scanning**: Using CheckMarx, Checkov, and Stryker for vulnerability scanning and code analysis.

## 10. Disaster Recovery Plan
To ensure resilience, a comprehensive backup plan will be established:

- **Regular Backups**: Automated backups of all code and configurations.
- **Disaster Recovery Drills**: Regular testing of recovery procedures to ensure preparedness.

## 11. Front-End Options
Three options for the front-end interface to trigger AWS Lambda functions:

1. **AWS Management Console**: Simple and direct, ideal for smaller teams.
2. **Custom Web Interface**: A tailored web application for more control and customization.
3. **Chatbot Integration**: Using services like AWS Lex for a conversational interface.

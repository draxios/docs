## 1. What Are Bedrock Agents?

AWS Bedrock Agents are higher‐level abstractions built on top of Bedrock’s generative AI models. Rather than simply sending a raw prompt to a model, you configure an “agent” with instructions (or a chain-of-thought) that guides it through multi-step reasoning, validation, or transformation of your data. The idea is to encapsulate business logic in the prompts and have the agent return structured output.

### Key Points:
- **Encapsulated Logic:** You set up the agent with a prompt (or multiple prompts) that instructs it on how to process your input payload.
- **Structured Output:** The agent returns output that includes information such as whether the request is approved, any modifications to the payload, and—even instructions (or “action hints”) on what to do next.
- **Decoupled Execution:** The agent itself does not directly invoke AWS services (like Lambda functions). Instead, your application (e.g., your processing Lambda) interprets the agent’s output and then triggers the next step (for example, calling the Jira integration Lambda).

## 2. How to “Give” the Agent Your Request

Rather than using a low-level SDK call that directly invokes a model (e.g., `bedrock.invoke_model`), you would:

1. **Define Your Agent’s Configuration:**  
   You’ll create an agent configuration (this could be done via a configuration file, AWS console, or API) that includes:
   - **Task Description:** “Validate a Jira ticket request payload.”
   - **Chain-of-Thought / Prompts:** Instructions such as “Analyze the payload, check if all required fields are present, and if valid, output a JSON with an approved flag and optionally a callback instruction.”
   - **Output Format:** A specification that the output should include fields like `approved` (Boolean) and, if approved, an optional field such as `action: "invoke_jira_lambda"` along with any necessary parameters.

2. **Call the Agent with Your Payload:**  
   In your processing Lambda (triggered from DynamoDB Streams), instead of a direct raw API call, you call your pre-configured agent. You pass the payload and any necessary context. For example:

   ```python
   def call_bedrock_agent_via_agent_config(payload):
       # Pseudocode: Your agent configuration is already set up in Bedrock
       # You now call the "agent endpoint" with your payload.
       agent_input = {
           "instructions": "Validate this Jira ticket request and if approved, output action details.",
           "payload": payload
       }
       response = bedrock_agent_client.invoke_agent(
           AgentId='your-agent-id',  # This is the pre-configured agent that encapsulates your logic.
           Body=json.dumps(agent_input).encode('utf-8')
       )
       # Assume the response is a JSON structure.
       result = json.loads(response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8'))
       return result
   ```

   **Note:** The above is pseudocode. AWS might offer a specific method (or a new client) for invoking agents. Consult the latest AWS Bedrock documentation for exact API calls.

3. **Interpret the Agent’s Response:**  
   Your agent might return a response like this:

   ```json
   {
     "approved": true,
     "action": "invoke_jira_lambda",
     "parameters": {
         "ticketDetails": {
             "title": "Sample Issue",
             "description": "Description of the issue...",
             "priority": "High"
         }
     }
   }
   ```

   Your Lambda then checks if `approved` is `true` and whether an `action` is provided. If the action is `"invoke_jira_lambda"`, your code will then trigger that Lambda with the provided parameters.

---

## 3. How the Agent “Calls Its Own Lambda” (or Triggers Follow-Up Actions)

The agent itself does not directly execute AWS Lambda functions. Instead, you build that logic in your orchestration Lambda that calls the agent. For example:

1. **Receive and Process the DynamoDB Event:**  
   Your processing Lambda receives the new record from DynamoDB.
2. **Pass the Payload to the Bedrock Agent:**  
   You call your agent (as described above) with the payload.
3. **Check the Agent's Structured Response:**  
   If the agent’s output indicates approval and includes an action (e.g., `"invoke_jira_lambda"`), then your code invokes the Jira integration Lambda:
   
   ```python
   agent_response = call_bedrock_agent_via_agent_config(payload)
   
   if agent_response.get('approved') and agent_response.get('action') == "invoke_jira_lambda":
       jira_payload = agent_response['parameters']['ticketDetails']
       lambda_client.invoke(
           FunctionName=os.environ.get('JIRA_LAMBDA_ARN'),
           InvocationType='Event',  # asynchronous call
           Payload=json.dumps({"ticketDetails": jira_payload})
       )
   else:
       # Handle non-approved cases or log the outcome.
       print("Payload did not pass validation or no action was specified.")
   ```

4. **(Optional) Use a Callback Mechanism:**  
   Some designs might include a callback URL or message bus where the agent can “suggest” that the next step be executed. However, the typical pattern is that your application acts on the agent's response rather than having the agent directly invoke a service.

## 4. Summary of the Agent-Enabled Workflow

- **User/UI Layer:**  
  Sends a JSON payload (via API Gateway) to your Ingest Lambda.
  
- **Ingest Lambda:**  
  Writes the payload to DynamoDB.
  
- **DynamoDB Streams & Processing Lambda:**  
  Triggers the processing Lambda, which now:
  1. Calls your pre-configured Bedrock Agent with the payload.
  2. Receives structured output (e.g., `{ "approved": true, "action": "invoke_jira_lambda", ... }`).
  3. Based on the agent’s instructions, conditionally invokes the Jira Integration Lambda.

- **Jira Integration Lambda:**  
  Processes the approved payload and creates/manages the Jira ticket via the Jira API.

## 5. What This Means for Your Implementation

- **Agent Configuration:**  
  You must set up and configure your Bedrock Agent (using the AWS Bedrock Agent features) with the proper prompts and expected output format. This configuration encapsulates your business logic for validating the ticket request.

- **Delegated Decision Making:**  
  The agent’s output is used to determine the next steps (such as invoking another Lambda). Your processing Lambda acts as the “orchestrator” by interpreting the agent’s result and taking the appropriate action.

- **Decoupling vs. Direct Calls:**  
  Although you mentioned “letting the agent call its own Lambda,” in practice, the agent’s design is to return actionable output. Your orchestration code then makes the service call (e.g., to the Jira Lambda). This keeps each component decoupled, testable, and easier to maintain.

---

By following this pattern, you leverage the power of Bedrock Agents to encapsulate complex decision logic while keeping your AWS Lambda functions responsible for service orchestration. This approach makes it straightforward to test each part in isolation—your agent logic, its output interpretation, and the subsequent Lambda invocations.

If AWS introduces more direct integration (such as built-in callback mechanisms) in future releases of Bedrock Agents, you could adapt your architecture accordingly. For now, the recommended approach is to have your agent return structured output that your application logic then uses to drive further actions.
